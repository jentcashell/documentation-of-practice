This image shows a screen shot of my research process. I examined a variety of articles/ papers about online marketing in relation to Instagram, as well as on Instagram impact on users' mental health. I also looks up some contemporary artworks about social media, for example the embrodery work by @hanecdote, which tells a narative about human interaction via social media.
